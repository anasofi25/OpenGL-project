# OpenGL Scene - A Day at the Farm



## Overview
This project is a 3D farm scene built using OpenGL. It features a realistic environment with dynamic lighting, weather effects, and animated objects. The scene includes a farmhouse, barn, animals, and a lake with animated ducks, creating an immersive rural landscape.

## Implementation Details
- **OpenGL 4.1 Core** for high-performance rendering.
- **GLFW** for cross-platform window management.
- **GLM** for mathematical computations.
- **Blender** used for asset creation.

## Controls
### 🖥️ Keyboard
- `W/A/S/D` - Move camera
- `V` - Switch visualization mode
- `F` - Toggle fog
- `U/I` - Move camera up/down
- `J/L` - Switch between day/night
- `T` - Start cinematic animation
- `ESC` - Exit

### 🖱️ Mouse
- Rotate camera view (yaw/pitch)

## Future Improvements
✔ Collision detection for the camera.
✔ Advanced animations for animals.
✔ Seasonal changes (snow, autumn leaves).
✔ Sound design and background music.
✔ More detailed shadow rendering.
